My personal baseball anlaytics research projects that I conduct to build my skill set in my pursuit of a carrer in a baseball front office.

These projects are based on the statistical assessments detailed in the "The Book: PLaying the Percentages in Baseball" by Tom Tango, Mitchel Lichtman, and Andrew Dolphin.
Since nearly 20 years have passed since the book's release, there are certain conclusions that I am curious to see if they still hold up. The codes I post in this repository are used to generate the
dataframes and tables I'll eventually use for data visualization.

To access the excel files I load into R, this link should take you to the dropbox needed to download the same files.

Here's hoping this readme will one day serve as a reminder of my beginnings to look back on one day.
