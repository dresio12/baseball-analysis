An unorganized small collection of my personal baseball anlaytics research projects.

Some projects are things I am simply testing out to see what happens (the PCA file is an example of that). Other projects are based on the statistical assessments detailed in the "The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball" by Tom Tango, Mitchel Lichtman, and Andrew Dolphin.
Since nearly 20 years have passed since the book's release, there are certain conclusions that I am curious to see if they still hold up. The codes I post in this repository are used to generate the
dataframes and tables I'll eventually use for data visualization.

To access the excel files I load into R, this link should take you to the dropbox needed to download the same files. Many are too big to be uploaded straight to here.

Also included are my final assignments for SABR level 2 certification (the Vladdy file) and level 3 (pf_adj_ops.R)
